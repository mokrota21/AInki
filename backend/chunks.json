    "# Chapter 2\n\n# Starting at the beginning: the natural numbers\n\nIn this text, we will review the material you have learnt in high school and in elementary calculus classes, but as rigorously as possible.",
    " To do so we will have to begin at the very basics - indeed, we will go back to the concept of numbers and what their properties are.",
    " Of course, you have dealt with numbers for over ten years and you know how to manipulate the rules of algebra to simplify any expression involving numbers, but we will now turn to a more fundamental issue, which is: why do the rules of algebra work at all?",
    " For instance, why is it true that $a ( b + c )$ is equal to $a b + a c$ for any three numbers $a , b , c$ ?",
    " This is not an arbitrary choice of rule; it can be proven from more primitive, and more fundamental, properties of the number system.",
    " This will teach you a new skill - how to prove complicated properties from simpler ones.",
    " You will find that even though a statement may be \u201cobvious\u201d, it may not be easy to prove; the material here will give you plenty of practice in doing so, and in the process will lead you to think about why an obvious statement really is obvious.",
    " One skill in particular that you will pick up here is the use of mathematical induction, which is a basic tool in proving things in many areas of mathematics.",
    "\n\nSo in the first few chapters we will re-acquaint you with various number systems that are used in real analysis.",
    " In increasing order of sophistication, they are the natural numbers $\\mathbf { N }$ ; the integers $\\mathbf { Z }$ ; the rationals $\\mathbf { Q }$ , and the real numbers $\\mathbf { R }$ .",
    " (There are other number systems such as the complex numbers $\\mathbf { C }$ , but we will not study them until Section 11.",
    "26.",
    ") The natural numbers $\\{ 0 , 1 , 2 , \\ldots \\}$ are the most primitive of the number systems, but they are used to build the integers, which in turn are used to build the rationals.",
    " Furthermore, the rationals are used to build the real numbers, which are in turn used to build the complex numbers.",
    " Thus to begin at the very beginning, we must look at the natural numbers.",
    " We will consider the following question: how does one actually define the natural numbers?",
    " (This is a very different question from how to use the natural numbers, which is something you of course know how to do very well.",
    " It\u2019s like the difference between knowing how to use, say, a computer, versus knowing how to build that computer.",
    ")\n\nThis question is more difficult to answer than it looks.",
    " The basic problem is that you have used the natural numbers for so long that they are embedded deeply into your mathematical thinking, and you can make various implicit assumptions about these numbers (e.",
    "g.",
    ", that $a + b$ is always equal to $b + a$ ) without even aware that you are doing so; it is difficult to let go and try to inspect this number system as if it is the first time you have seen it.",
    " So in what follows I will have to ask you to perform a rather difficult task: try to set aside, for the moment, everything you know about the natural numbers; forget that you know how to count, to add, to multiply, to manipulate the rules of algebra, etc. We will try to introduce these concepts one at a time and identify explicitly what our assumptions are as we go along - and not allow ourselves to use more \u201cadvanced\u201d tricks such as the rules of algebra until we have actually proven them.",
    " This may seem like an irritating constraint, especially as we will spend a lot of time proving statements which are \u201cobvious\u201d, but it is necessary to do this suspension of known facts to avoid circularity (e.",
    "g.",
    ", using an advanced fact to prove a more elementary fact, and then later using the elementary fact to prove the advanced fact).",
    " Also, this exercise will be an excellent way to affirm the foundations of your mathematical knowledge.",
    " Furthermore, practicing your proofs and abstract thinking here will be invaluable when we move on to more advanced concepts, such as real numbers, functions, sequences and series, differentials and integrals, and so forth.",
    " In short, the results here may seem trivial, but the journey is much more important than the destination, for now.",
    " (Once the number systems are constructed properly, we can resume using the laws of algebra etc. without having to rederive them each time.",
    ")\n\nWe will also forget that we know the decimal system, which of course is an extremely convenient way to manipulate numbers, but it is not something which is fundamental to what numbers are.",
    " (For instance, one could use an octal or binary system instead of the decimal system, or even the Roman numeral system, and still get exactly the same set of numbers.",
    ") Besides, if one tries to fully explain what the decimal number system is, it isn\u2019t as natural as you might think.",
    " Why is 00423 the same number as 423, but 32400 isn\u2019t the same number as 324?",
    " Why is 123.",
    "4444 .",
    " .",
    " .",
    " a real number, while .",
    " .",
    " .",
    " 444.",
    "321 is not?",
    " And why do we have to carry of digits when adding or multiplying?",
    " Why is 0.",
    "999 .",
    " .",
    " .",
    " the same number as 1?",
    " What is the smallest positive real number?",
    " Isn\u2019t it just 0.",
    "00 .",
    " .",
    " .",
    " 001?",
    " So to set aside these problems, we will not try to assume any knowledge of the decimal system, though we will of course still refer to numbers by their familiar names such as 1,2,3, etc. instead of using other notation such as I,II,III or $0 { + } { + }$ , $( 0 { + } 1 ) { + } 1$ , $( ( 0 + + ) + + ) + +$ (see below) so as not to be needlessly artificial.",
    " For completeness, we review the decimal system in an Appendix ( B).",
    "\n\n# 2.",
    "1 The Peano axioms\n\nWe now present one standard way to define the natural numbers, in terms of the Peano axioms, which were first laid out by Guiseppe Peano (1858\u20131932).",
    " This is not the only way to define the natural numbers.",
    " For instance, another approach is to talk about the cardinality of finite sets, for instance one could take a set of five elements and define 5 to be the number of elements in that set.",
    " We shall discuss this alternate approach in Section 3.",
    "6.",
    " However, we shall stick with the Peano axiomatic approach for now.",
    "\n\nHow are we to define what the natural numbers are?",
    " Informally, we could say\n\nDefinition 2.",
    "1.",
    "1.",
    " (Informal) A natural number is any element of the set\n\n$$\n\\mathbf { N } : = \\{ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , .",
    " .",
    " .",
    " \\} ,\n$$\n\nwhich is the set of all the numbers created by starting with 0 and then counting forward indefinitely.",
    " We call $\\mathbf { N }$ the set of natural numbers.",
    "\n\nRemark 2.",
    "1.",
    "2.",
    " In some texts the natural numbers start at 1 instead of $0$ , but this is a matter of notational convention more than anything else.",
    " In this text we shall refer to the set $\\{ 1 , 2 , 3 , \\ldots \\}$ as the positive integers $\\mathbf { Z } ^ { + }$ rather than the natural numbers.",
    " Natural numbers are sometimes also known as whole numbers.",
    "\n\nIn a sense, this definition solves the problem of what the natural numbers are: a natural number is any element of the set $^ { 1 }$ $\\mathbf { N }$ .",
    " However, it is not really that satisfactory, because it begs the question of what $\\mathbf { N }$ is.",
    " This definition of \u201cstart at 0 and count indefinitely\u201d seems like an intuitive enough definition of $\\mathbf { N }$ , but it is not entirely acceptable, because it leaves many questions unanswered.",
    " For instance: how do we know we can keep counting indefinitely, without cycling back to 0?",
    " Also, how do you perform operations such as addition, multiplication, or exponentiation?",
    "\n\nWe can answer the latter question first: we can define complicated operations in terms of simpler operations.",
    " Exponentiation is nothing more than repeated multiplication: $5 ^ { 3 }$ is nothing more than three fives multiplied together.",
    " Multiplication is nothing more than repeated addition; $5 \\times 3$ is nothing more than three fives added together.",
    " (Subtraction and division will not be covered here, because they are not operations which are well-suited to the natural numbers; they will have to wait for the integers and rationals, respectively.",
    ") And addition?",
    " It is nothing more than the repeated operation of counting forward, or incrementing.",
    " If you add three to five, what you are doing is incrementing five three times.",
    " On the other hand, incrementing seems to be a fundamental operation, not reducible to any simpler operation; indeed, it is the first operation one learns on numbers, even before learning to add.",
    "\n\nThus, to define the natural numbers, we will use two fundamental concepts: the zero number 0, and the increment operation.",
    " In deference to modern computer languages, we will use $^ { n + + }$ to denote the increment or successor of $n$ , thus for instance $3 { \\mathrel { + } } + = 4$ , $( 3 + + ) + + = 5$ , etc. This is a slightly different usage from that in computer languages such as $C$ , where $^ { n + + }$ actually redefines the value of $n$ to be its successor; however in mathematics we try not to define a variable more than once in any given setting, as it can often lead to confusion; many of the statements which were true for the old value of the variable can now become false, and vice versa.",
    "\n\nSo, it seems like we want to say that $\\mathbf { N }$ consists of 0 and everything which can be obtained from 0 by incrementing: $\\mathbf { N }$ should consist of the objects\n\n$$\n0 , 0 + + , ( 0 + + ) + + , ( ( 0 + + ) + + ) + + , \\mathrm { e t c .",

    " This type of thing actually happens in real life, when one uses a computer to try to store a natural number: if one starts at 0 and performs the increment operation repeatedly, eventually the computer will overflow its memory and the number will wrap around back to 0 (though this may take quite a large number of incrementation operations, for instance a two-byte representation of an integer will wrap around only after 65, 536 increments).",
