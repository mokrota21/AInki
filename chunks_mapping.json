To do\nso we will have to begin at the very basics - indeed, we will go back to the\nconcept of numbers and what their properties are. Of course, you have\ndealt with numbers for over ten years and you know how to manipulate\nthe rules of algebra to simplify any expression involving numbers, but\nwe will now turn to a more fundamental issue, which is: why do the rules\nof algebra work at all? For instance, why is it true that a(b+c) is equal\nto ab + ac for any three numbers a, b, c? This is not an arbitrary choice\nof rule; it can be proven from more primitive, and more fundamental,\nproperties of the number system. This will teach you a new skill - how\nto prove complicated properties from simpler ones. You will find that\neven though a statement may be \"obvious\", it may not be easy to prove;\nthe m",

In increasing order of\nsophistication, they are the natural numbers N; the integers Z; the ra-\ntionals Q, and the real numbers R.

The natural numbers {0,1,2, ... } are the most primitive of\nthe number systems, but they are used to build the integers, which in\nturn are used to build the rationals.
